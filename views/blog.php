						<br>Team Bottcher, featuring University of Alberta Golden Bears curling alumni Brendan Bottcher, Brad Thiessen, and Karrick Martin, as well as newest member Tom Appleman, have won the German Masters event during a Curling Champions Tour in Hamburg, over the January 23-25th weekend. 

As a tune-up Alberta Provincials draw, Team Bottcher won all seven games in Hamburg to go undefeated at the event. In round robin play, the team beat 2014 Sochi Olympic silver medalist David Murdoch by a score of 6-3, and in the final game Team Bottcher scored a quick 6-2 victory after seven ends over 2013 European Champion Sven Michel. 

Team Bottcher now sits in 11th place on the Order of Merit Ranking, year-to-date, and sixth overall on the money list. 

With the win, they have also earned a second seed at the Boston Pizza Cup Alberta Men’s Championship. They will compete in Wainwright February 4-8th for a berth to The Brier.

						<br>It almost feels like Brendan Bottcher’s Saville Centre rink of Tom Appelman, Brad Thiessen and Karrick Martin is doing it backward.

While most teams earn a trip overseas by winning a Canadian title, Bottcher opted to take a trip to Europe so he could hopefully win the Boston Pizza Cup Alberta men’s curling championship Feb. 4-8 at Wainwright.

Bottcher entered the German Masters, which starts Friday at Hamburg, Germany, to play some competitive games.

“We’re going there mostly for preparation because it’s the week before provincials,” Bottcher said. “Because we got the direct bye into provincials, we had a month and a half, two months where we don’t have any games.”

Unless teams qualify for the Continental Cup or Pinty’s Skins Game, there aren’t any events in Canada featuring good ice and top-calibre competition from early to mid-December until after the provincials in early February.

It certainly didn’t hurt that Bottcher, a University of Alberta student, won enough money ($44,750) on the World Curling Tour this season to cover the rink’s expenses.

“Last year, we tried to practise as much as we could,” said Bottcher, who also had a bye to the 2014 championship.

“We threw a ton of rocks, but we didn’t throw a ton of rocks in curling games and there is a bit of a difference there. We were out here (at the Saville Community Sports Centre) three or four times a week with Rob (Krepps, their coach) and much more than that by ourselves.

“We got to provincials and we just didn’t have that game practice that we needed. We were just a little bit slow, we didn’t have our systems down, it was a bit of a struggle for us.

“We wanted to build that in this year and make sure that we were prepared,” Bottcher said about the trip to Germany.
